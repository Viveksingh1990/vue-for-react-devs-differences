Form Submission
===============

Picking up from the previous lesson, we have to finish the form component by listening to the form `submit` event and processing the form data.

Submitting the form
-------------------

Just like in a React app, we want to prevent the default submission and replace that with our own callback function.

We can do that by listening to the `@submit` event with the `prevent` modifier:

ðŸ“ƒÂ **src/components/ReviewForm.vue**

    <form class="review-form" @submit.prevent="onSubmit">
      ...
    </form>
    

Finally, create the `onSubmit` callback and emit a new event with the form data:

ðŸ“ƒÂ **src/components/ReviewForm.vue**

    const emit = defineEmits(['review-submitted'])
    ...
    const onSubmit = () => {
      const reviewData = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(review))
      emit('review-submitted', reviewData)
    }
    

The reason why weâ€™re sending a _stringified_ object of the form data instead of the original reactive object is because we want to reuse this variable for future form submissions. And so we donâ€™t want the data that weâ€™re sending out of this form to still be reactive.

* * *

Clearing the form
-----------------

After the `emit`, we have to clear out all the form fields:

    const onSubmit = () => {
      const reviewData = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(review))
      emit('review-submitted', reviewData)
    
      // reset
      review.name = ''
      review.content = ''
      review.rating = null
    }
    

* * *

If you donâ€™t like having multiple statements to clear our all the form fields, you can use `Object.assign`:

    Object.assign(review, {
      name: '',
      content: '',
      rating: null
    })
    

* * *

If you donâ€™t like repeating the same form data in multiple places, you can extract it to a variable that you can reuse for both _initialization_ and _reset_:

    const defaultFormData = {
      name: '',
      content: '',
      rating: null
    }
    
    // initialization
    const review = reactive({...defaultFormData})
    ...
    const onSubmit = () => {
      ...
      // reset
      Object.assign(review, defaultFormData)
    }
    

But make sure that youâ€™re using the three-dot syntax to create a new object with `defaultFormData` for `reactive()`. If you pass `defaultFormData` directly into `reactive()`, it will get modified because the review object will be linked to the `defaultFormData` object.

So if you want a more fool-proof method, you can wrap the data in a function:

    const getDefaultFormData = () => ({
      name: '',
      content: '',
      rating: null
    })
    
    // initialization
    const review = reactive(getDefaultFormData())
    ...
    const onSubmit = () => {
      ...
      // reset
      Object.assign(review, getDefaultFormData())
    }
    

* * *

Handling the custom event
-------------------------

Now that the form is ready, we can go back to **ProductDisplay** and import the form component:

    <script setup>
    import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
    import ReviewForm from '@/components/ReviewForm.vue'
    

Put the `ReviewForm` element at the bottom of `product-display`, and listen for the `review-submitted` event:

    <template>  
      <div class="product-display">  
        ...
        <ReviewForm @review-submitted="addReview"></ReviewForm>
      </div>
    </template>
    

Create an array ref called `reviews`, and set up the `addReview` callback to add the review data to this new ref:

    const reviews = ref([])
    ...
    const addReview = (review) => {
      reviews.value.push(review)
    }
    

To make sure that this is working, you can `console.log` the reviews value:

    const addReview = (review) => {
      reviews.value.push(review)
      console.log(reviews.value)
    }
    

After submitting a review using the form, you should see a proxy object in the console, it has a `[[target]]` field pointing to an array containing the form data you just submitted:

Showing the reviews
-------------------

Now weâ€™re going to display the list of reviews. We have to first create a new component for that:

ðŸ“ƒÂ **src/components/ReviewList.vue**

    <script setup>
    defineProps({
      reviews: {
        type: Array,
        required: true
      }
    })
    </script>
    
    <template>
      <div class="review-container">
        <h3>Reviews:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li v-for="(review, index) in reviews" :key="index">
            <span>{{ review.name }} gave this {{ review.rating }} stars</span>
            <br/>
            <span>{{ review.content }}</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </template>
    

Itâ€™s a simple component that receives an array prop and render it using v-for.

Since weâ€™re not using the prop in the script, we donâ€™t have to create a variable for the props. The `review` prop will be made available to the `<template>` automatically.

Back in **ProductDisplay**, we have to import the component, and render `<ReviewList>` right above the `<ReviewForm>`:

ðŸ“ƒÂ **src/components/ProductDisplay.vue**

    <script>
    import ReviewList from '@/components/ReviewList.vue'
    ...
    <ReviewList></ReviewList>
    <ReviewForm @review-submitted="addReview"></ReviewForm>
    
    

And then pass the `reviews` data as a prop:

ðŸ“ƒÂ **src/components/ProductDisplay.vue**

    <ReviewList :reviews="reviews"></ReviewList>
    

If you fill out and submit the form, you should now see the new review appearing in the _Reviews_ container:

Now that we have more components in our app, weâ€™re going to explore the different patterns of mixing the components with _slot_ in the next lesson.
